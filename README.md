crazyflie_cooper_ros
=============

ROS stack for Bitcraze Crazyflie (http://www.bitcraze.se/), with the following features:

* Support for Crazyflie 1.0 and Crazyflie 2.0 (using stock firmware)
* Publishes on-board sensors in ROS standard message formats
* Supports ROS parameters to reconfigure crazyflie parameters
* Support for using multiple Crazyflies with a single Crazyradio
* Includes external controller for waypoint navigation (if motion capture system is available)
* No dependency to the Bitcraze SDK (Driver and Controller written in C++)

A tutorial (for a slightly older version) is available in W. Hönig and N. Ayanian. "Flying Multiple UAVs Using ROS", Chapter in Robot Operating System (ROS): The Complete Reference (Volume 2), Springer, 2017. (see http://act.usc.edu/publications.html for a free pre-print).

If you want to control many Crazyflies or look for a good controller for a single Crazyflie, take a look at http://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. We are currently in the process to unify the Crazyswarm and crazyflie_ros as well as contributing the Crazyswarm firmware changes back to the official firmware.

## Installation (Cooper Specific)

Install VS Code:
`sudo snap install --classic code`

Install ROS, we are unsing ROS Kinetic with Ubuntu Xenial 16.04

Read up through section 3.2 of the following [USC paper](http://act.usc.edu/publications/Hoenig_Springer_ROS2017.pdf). 3.3 details updating the CF firmware, do so if necessary. 

Create a catkin workspace accordingly
```
mkdir -p ~/crazyflie_ws/src
cd ~/crazyflie_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Clone this repository and update submodules
```
git clone https://github.com/CooperControlsLab/crazyflie_cooper_ros.git
cd crazyflie_cooper_ros
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Clone vicon_bridge package into workspace
```
cd ~/crazyflie_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/vicon_bridge.git
```

Use `catkin_make` on your workspace to compile.

Navigate to `~/crazyflie_ws/src/vicon_bridge/launch` and set hostport address to `199.98.17.181:801` in the `vicon.launch` file

See [here](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:dev:fimware:sensor_to_control) for a block diagram of the low-level crazyflie controller

See [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05786.pdf) for detailed crazyflie system modeling

## Usage

There are six packages included: crazyflie_cpp, crazyflie_driver, crazyflie_tools, crazyflie_description, crazyflie_controller, and crazyflie_demo.
Note that the below description might be slightly out-of-date, as we continue merging the Crazyswarm and crazyflie_ros.

### Crazyflie_demo (Cooper Demos are here!)

This package contains a rich set of examples to get quickly started with the Crazyflie. The general structure is as follows:

**1 - Launch**: Launches the controller node which publishes `cmd_vel` messages to the crazyflie through use of various off-board controllers. A unique Crazyflie ROS namespace is generated depending on the number of Drones that are desired for the particular demo. 

**2 - Individual Crazyflie Scripts**: A unique Python file is called by the Launch file, one for each Crazyflie. This file instantiates the `CooperativeQuad` class which instructs the high level maneuvers that are desired for the particular Crazyflie flight.

**3 - `a_cooperative_quad.py`**: Contains the `CooperativeQuad` class which holds parameters relevant to each individual Crazyflie and instructions for flight maneuvers such as hovering, trajectory  tracking, and landing.

**4 - `a_cf_controller_phys.py`**: Contains the control algorithms that are used in the flight maneuvers.

The following image displays which maneuvers and control algorithms are currently available:

#### Single Drone Hover

**Description**: Runs a hover controller for a single crazyflie at position (0,0,0.3). Uses VICON position feedback for localization. 

**Launch**: Launch the following file with `crazyflie3` enabled in Vicon Tracker.
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo a_hover_stiff.launch
```
**Notes**: Follows the hover controller described in section 3.1.2 of the following thesis: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05786.pdf

#### Multi Drone Hover

**Description**: Runs the hover controller on three drones

**Launch**: Launch the following file with `crazyflie3`, `crazyflie4`, and `crazyflie5` enabled in Vicon Tracker.
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo a_hover_stiff_multi.launch
```
**Notes**: Follows the hover controller described in section 3.1.2 of the following thesis: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05786.pdf

#### Single Drone Trajectory Tracking

**Description**: Runs a trajectory tracking algorithm on a single drone

**Launch**: Launch the following file with `crazyflie4` enabled in Vicon Tracker
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo a_traj_tracking.launch
```

**Notes**: Follows a 2D version of the trajectory tracking controller described in seciton 2.2.2 of the following thesis: https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1705&context=edissertations

#### Multi Drone Trajectory Tracking Mimicing Standing Wave Mode 1

**Description**: Runs three drones following a standing wave pattern. Can run `a_traj_generator.py` in `scripts` folder to see wave creation options

**Launch**: Launch the following file with `crazyflie3`, `crazyflie4`, and `crazyflie5` enabled in Vicon Tracker
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo a_standing_wave_multi.launch
```

**Notes**: Follows the same trajectory tracking algorithm described in demo above

#### Magic Wand Demo

**Description**: Runs an interactive demo where a swarm of Crazyflie drones track a pencil object, see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sCPa3kySQ. 

**Launch**: Launch the following file with `pencil`, `crazyflie3`, `crazyflie4`, and `crazyflie5` objects enabled in Vicon Tracker.
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo pencil_tracker.launch
```

Start each drone in a seperate terminal window by calling the following services
`rosservice call /crazyflie3/takeoff`
`rosservice call /crazyflie4/takeoff`
`rosservice call /crazyflie5/takeoff`

Can also run `emergency` or `land` services to either cut power or conduct a graceful landing maneuver

**Notes**: Uses the stock cpp controller contained in the Crazyflie_controller directory

### Crazyflie_demo\model

**Description**: Model of the Crazyflie 2.1 system following dynamics listed in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05786.pdf using a Python controller layout described by Randal Beard in the book `Quadrotor Dynamics and Control Rev 0.1`

**Launch**: Run the following file in the `tests` folder
```
python test_controller.py
```

### Crazyflie_Cpp

This package contains a cpp library for the Crazyradio and Crazyflie. It can be used independently of ROS.

### Crazyflie_driver

This package contains the driver. In order to support multiple Crazyflies with a single Crazyradio, there is crazyflie_server (communicating with all Crazyflies) and crazyflie_add to dynamically add Crazyflies.
The server does not communicate to any Crazyflie initially, hence crazyflie_add needs to be used.

### Crazyflie_tools

This package contains tools which are helpful, but not required for normal operation. So far, it just support one tool for scanning for a Crazyflie.

You can find connected Crazyflies using:
```
rosrun crazyflie_tools scan
```

### Crazyflie_description

This package contains a 3D model of the Crazyflie (1.0). This is for visualization purposes in rviz.

### Crazyflie_controller

This package contains a simple PID controller for hovering or waypoint navigation.
It can be used with external motion capture systems, such as VICONhttps://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1705&context=edissertations.

## ROS Features

### Parameters

The launch file supports the following arguments:
* uri: Specifier for the crazyflie, e.g. radio://0/80/2M
* tf_prefix: tf prefix for the crazyflie frame(s)
* roll_trim: Trim in degrees, e.g. negative if flie drifts to the left
* pitch_trim: Trim in degrees, e.g. negative if flie drifts forward

See http://wiki.bitcraze.se/projects:crazyflie:userguide:tips_and_tricks for details on how to obtain good trim values.

### Subscribers

#### cmd_vel

Similar to the hector_quadrotor, package the fields are used as following:
* linear.y: roll [e.g. -30 to 30 degrees]
* linear.x: pitch [e.g. -30 to 30 degrees]
* angular.z: yawrate [e.g. -200 to 200 degrees/second]
* linear.z: thrust [10000 to 60000 (mapped to PWM output)]

## Notes

* The dynamic_reconfigure package (http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/) seems like a good fit to map the parameters, however it has severe limitations:
  * Changed-Callback does not include which parameter(s) were changed. There is only a notion of a level which is a simple bitmask. This would cause that on any parameter change we would need to update all parameters on the Crazyflie.
  * Parameters are statically generated. There are hacks to add parameters at runtime, however those might not work with future versions of dynamic_reconfigure.
  * Groups not fully supported (https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/162; This seems to be closed now, however the Indigo binary packages did not pick up the fixes yet).
